You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```javascript
// Hi :)
var a = "test";
function b(msg){
  this.altMsg = ":D This is a really long piece of text to test text wrapping with prism";
  console.log(msg);
}
b(a);

b.prototype.showAltMsg = function() {
  console.log(this.altMsg);
}
b.showAltMsg();
```
